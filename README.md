Other tips:
- Branching is the key concept in Git. And it works around the rule that the master branch is ALWAYS deployable
- When you make a new branch, you will (almost always) want to make it from the master branch.
- Use descriptive names for new branches!
- Each commit should have a message explaining what has changed and why. Each commit becomes a part of the history of the branch, and a point you can revert back to if you need to.
- When a Pull Request is made, it can be reviewed by whoever has the proper access to the branch. This is where good discussions and review of the changes happen.
